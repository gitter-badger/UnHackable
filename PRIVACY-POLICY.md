# UnHackable Privacy Policy

UnHackable generates random passwords and thus I dont have any control over how the password is generated
thus meaning that the same password maybe generated for two users at same time or maybe generated to another
user a year later. If you comply with our privacy policy then only install the app or else we dont take any
for your password being guessed easily.
